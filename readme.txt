BUilding a website for my Band
Yoasobi is a 2 person band, I want to make a website for their fans to find out more about them,and to know more about their music. 
this website also allows them to buy concert tickets for their concert and to 
keep in touch with the band notifications through emails.



Design Process
This website is for their fans to know more about them, to be able to listen to their music and essentially buy their concert tickets to see them in person.
 My target audience is people who just listened to their songs and would want to know more about them.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

This website is created for fans to buy tickets to their concert and to be known world wide. 
The wireframe is in the folder.

Features
1. Able to buy more tickets through the concert page by filling up a form
2. able to listen to their popular music on their page through youtube videos
3. able to know more about the band information
4. allows users to sign up for any notifications from the band themselves

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
Javascript
HTML
CSS

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Book Tickets page:
Go to the "concert" page
click on buy tickets
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
improvements:
- did not clarify the email address, cam input random values
- did not clarify the successfully booked message.

minimize all pages, use internet explorer as well on the pages, it should have responsiveness on the website. 

For mobile version:
the design is messy and needs to be improved.
the website responsive and the phone responsiveness is different from the phone


If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
